## 4. Analytics and Third-Party Services

### 4.1 PostHog Analytics
We use PostHog, a third-party analytics service, to help us understand how users interact with the Site. PostHog collects information about your usage of the Site, including:
- Page views and navigation patterns
- Feature usage and interactions
- Session recordings and heatmaps
- User behavior and engagement metrics
- Technical information about your device and browser
- Performance data

This information is used to:

PostHog may use cookies and similar technologies to collect this information. For more information about PostHog's privacy practices, please visit their privacy policy.

**Analytics Consent**: When you first visit the Site, you will be presented with a cookie consent banner that allows you to accept or decline analytics tracking.

**Implicit Consent**: If you continue to use the Site (by scrolling, clicking, or interacting with content) without explicitly declining, we will interpret this as consent to analytics tracking after approximately 5 seconds of interaction. A progress indicator on the "Accept" button shows when automatic consent will occur. This is known as "implied consent" or "consent by continued usage."

Your choice is stored in a cookie on your browser for 365 days. You can change your analytics preferences at any time by clearing your browser cookies and revisiting the Site, which will display the consent banner again.

### 4.2 Other Third-Party Services
We may use additional third-party services for hosting, email delivery, payment processing, or other purposes. These services may have access to your information as necessary to perform their functions.

## 5. How We Share Your Information

We may share your information in the following circumstances:

### 5.1 Broad Discretion
We reserve the right to share your information for any lawful purpose, including:
- With wedding hosts, organizers, and vendors
- With family members and other guests as appropriate
- With third-party service providers and partners
- For business purposes, including marketing and analytics
- In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets
- To enforce our Terms and Conditions
- To protect our rights, property, or safety
- To comply with legal obligations
- With your consent or at your direction

### 5.2 Aggregate Information
We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may retain information indefinitely for any legitimate business purpose.

## 7. Data Security

While we implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You acknowledge that:
- No method of transmission over the internet is completely secure
- No electronic storage system is entirely secure
- You provide information at your own risk
- We are not responsible for unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other security breaches

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

### 8.1 Limited Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. However, we may not honor such requests if we determine that:
- Doing so would compromise the integrity or functionality of the Site
- We have a legitimate business interest in retaining the information
- We are required by law to retain the information
- Honoring the request would be unduly burdensome

### 8.2 Analytics Opt-Out
You have the right to opt out of analytics tracking at any time:

**Cookie Consent Banner**: When you first visit the Site, you can decline analytics tracking through the cookie consent banner. If you decline, PostHog analytics will not collect data about your usage.

**Implicit Consent**: By default, if you continue to use the Site without making an explicit choice, we will assume you consent to analytics tracking after 5 seconds of interaction (scrolling, clicking, etc.). A visual progress indicator appears on the "Accept" button to show when automatic consent will occur. This approach prioritizes usability while still respecting user choice.

**Changing Your Choice**: To change your analytics preferences after making an initial choice, you can:
1. Clear your browser cookies for this Site
2. Revisit the Site, and the consent banner will appear again
3. Make a new selection (Accept or Decline)

Your analytics preference is stored in a cookie named `analytics_consent` that expires after 365 days. If this cookie is deleted or expires, you will be asked to make a choice again on your next visit.

### 8.3 Communication Opt-Out
You may opt out of certain communications by following unsubscribe instructions in emails we send. However, we may still send you administrative or transactional messages.

### 8.4 Do Not Track
We do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals from browsers.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 13, we may delete it or retain it at our discretion.

## 10. International Users

The Site is operated in the United States. If you access the Site from outside the United States, you acknowledge that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where privacy laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. By using the Site, you consent to such transfer and processing.

## 11. California Privacy Rights

California residents may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, because this Site is operated as a personal wedding website, certain exemptions may apply. We reserve the right to determine the applicability of such laws to our operations.
